  "Pure-function filing-draft + filing-submit record construction for
  the USA-GSA (General Services Administration) actor -- an
  append-only compliance book-of-record draft, one per filing track
  (`:sam-registration` / `:mas-schedule`).

  Like every sibling actor's registry, there is no single reference-
  number standard GSA assigns to a compliance filing-draft/filing-
  submit package this actor produces for its own audit trail -- this
  namespace does NOT invent one; it builds a track-scoped sequence
  number and validates the record's required fields, the same honest,
  non-fabricating discipline `gsacompliance.facts` uses.

  `engagement-fee-matches-claim?` is an HONEST reapplication of the
  SAME ground-truth-recompute DISCIPLINE sibling actors use (verify a
  claimed monetary total against the entity's own recorded quantity x
  unit fields), reapplied to this repo's own THREE-line revenue model
  (docs/business-model.md Revenue: 'per-engagement compliance-review
  fee' as base-fee + 'recurring regulatory-change monitoring
  subscription' as monthly-rate x monitoring-months + 'compliance-audit
  export package' as an optional flat export-fee, only when the
  engagement actually requested the export package).

  This namespace is pure data + pure functions -- no I/O, no network
  call to SAM.gov, GSA, or any government portal. It builds the RECORD
  an operator would keep, not the act of actually registering/filing
  itself (that is `gsacompliance.operation`'s `:filing/submit`, always
  human-gated -- see README Actuation)."
